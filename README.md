AI use statement



The following AI tools we're used:

* ChatGPT
* Copilot

AI was used in the following cases:

* Asked AI for the best way to disable a button within React for Issue 1.
* Copilot corrected the Issue 7 fix, to use "!!" instead of "!". I later learned this the "!!" is used as double negation, which is needed since the localStorage.getItem() function with one "!" will return a null if there is no token or return the token. The second "!" is needed to convert the output of that into a true or false.
* Copilot was used to figure out and program Issue 2. The main encountered issue was that I did not know where to define the handleDeleteProduct function and where to add the delete button.
* Copilot was also used to design the logic and implement Issues 3 and 4.
